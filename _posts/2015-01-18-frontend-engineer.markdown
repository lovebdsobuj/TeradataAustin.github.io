We’re looking for a Frontend web application engineer that cares about the overall user, developer and customer experience. Your responsibilities will overlap with UX designers and API developers as much as you like. We’d love someone that cares just as much about usability as code comments, and hates merge conflicts as much as we do!

Responsibilities:

- Work closely with UX designers to implement and create interactions
- Build platform-quality code that’s well tested and reusable
- Connect the dots between mockups & APIs
- Collaborate with end users to ensure usability
- Simplify complex user flows for analytical and administrative apps

Skills:

- MVVM JavaScript Pro (Angular, React, Ember, etc)
- Testing suite experience (Unit tests, Browser tests, Usability tests, etc)
- UI framework proficiency (Material-Angular, Polymer, Foundation, Bootstrap, etc)
- RESTful API consumption and design
- Some visualization framework experience (D3.js, Highcharts, Google Charts, etc)
- Use of build tools (Gulp, Grunt, Jenkins, etc)
- Git & Github experience (fork or branch model)
- Agile methodology (Scrum, Kanban, Lean)

Qualifications:

- 5+ years experience in frontend development
- BS or MS degree in computer science or related field
- Understanding of the difference between website & web application
- Understanding of the difference between dev & engineer

Work Environment:

- Centrally located office in the Arboretum area
- Work from home optionally
- Open workstations for collaboration
- Hangouts &amp; Slack for communication

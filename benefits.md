### Healthcare

Teradata offers you flexible, comprehensive health care benefits. These benefits include medical, prescription drug, dental and vision plans. By offering a health care spending account, Teradata enables you to set aside pre-tax dollars to help pay for your health care expenses—actual costs for which you are responsible—while decreasing your taxable income.

#### Dental

Teradata offers a choice of dental care options which cover preventive, basic, major and children’s orthodontic services. You also have the flexibility to choose a dental HMO plan, if available in your area; you may opt out of dental care coverage if you wish.

#### Vision

Regularly scheduled vision care appointments are important to your health and well-being. That’s why Teradata offers you the opportunity to purchase a vision plan with pre-tax dollars. This plan covers vision care and prescription eyewear through a network of optometrists and ophthalmologists.

### Compensation

**Base Pay**. Your immediate asset-builders are your base pay and bonus pay. Base pay is the largest component of your PayPlus. It is the cash flow most of us rely on to meet our regular financial needs.

**Incentive Pay**. Another immediate asset builder is your incentive pay—or bonus—opportunity. You receive incentive pay based on performance against individual as well as division/group objectives. For most Teradata employees not covered under the Solutions Compensation Plan (see below), incentive pay at Teradata is in the form of the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP). Incentive pay is based on the achievement of Teradata or Division performance for revenue and profit metrics.

**Solutions Compensation**. Teradata sales and services employees are covered by the Solutions Compensation Plan. The Solutions Compensation model provides flexibility in setting order, revenue and profit targets. The plan design rewards participants who sell total solutions and higher margin products and services. It also encourages the development of new accounts and aggressive revenue growth.

**Performance Awards**. For all employees, Teradata encourages immediate recognition of outstanding performance by granting performance awards to individuals. Performance awards provide a real and immediate opportunity to celebrate Teradata successes and to recognize our achievements—both large and small.
